\section*{Supplementary materials: data and results}

\subsection*{S1}
Languages, including latitude and longitude, used in the current study.

\input{languages}

\subsection*{S2a}

List of typological features (from DiACL database https://diacl.ht.lu.se) used in the current study.

Grid = topmost organizational unit in database, corresponding to linguistic domain; Feature = second organizational unit in database; Feature description = Description of Feature in database; Variant = lowest organizational unit in database; Variant description = description of variant in database; ID = unique database ID of Variant.

\input{features}

\subsection*{S2b}

Matrix of coding of schools with sources of data. ID = Variant ID of database (S2a).

\input{schools_binary}

\subsection*{S3a}

Categorical features and reconstructed probabilities of traits at the root of the tree. For each number or categorical feature in the column ``CFID'' (Categorical Feature ID), the top-most level of the hierarchically organized features in the original dataset (Grids in the dataset) are given by their name (e.g., Alignment), followed by a vertical line and the name of a Feature (e.g.. Noun: Present Progressive). This Feature may or may not correspond to a categorical feature; for this matter the combination of Grid|Feature may recur in several multistate characters. Each categorical feature has a unique ID number (1-64) and each trait has a unique ID number (A1-WO50). Each categorical feature is described as Grid|Feature|Variant (dataset terms), which are given next to the categorical feature ID. The combination of values (1/0), which represent the unique trait, are given in the row below each cell with a value of a categorical feature. The ID in the row gives the unique trait ID and the unique label describes the trait.

CFID = ID of multistate character block (for reference in text). Label = descriptive property label; ID = unique trait ID (A = alignment, NM = nominal morphology, T = tense, VM = verbal morphology, WO = word order); Variant (1-4) = Variant of multistate character from DiACL, given as Grid|Feature|Variant (see S2a); Result = reconstructed probability of presence for each trait at the protolanguage state.

\input{recoded_features}

\subsection*{S3b}

Coded variants of S2b (different schools) transformed into the traits of S3a, organized by their categorical features. ID = trait ID of S3a.

\input{schools_nonbinary}

\subsection*{S4}
Reconstruction probabilities for values of each variable.

\input{reconstruction_prob}


\subsection*{S5}
Transition rates for features, organized by category (S3a). %Mean rate = transition rate between features; Loss trait = trait which transition leads from; Loss ID = trait ID of loss character; Gain trait = trait which transition leads to; Gain ID = character ID of gain trait. 

\input{rates}

\subsection*{S6}
Entry and exit (gain and loss) rates of features. %For a description of how these are computed, see Appendix (8.5). 
%Trait = trait label; ID = trait ID; 
Type = A (alignment), NM (nominal morphology), T (tense), VM (verbal morphology), WO (word order).

\input{entry_exit}

\subsection*{S7}

List of pairwise organized features, which are identified to be in a relation by a marking hierarchy. Feature 1 = Trait higher in hierarchy (more frequent, unmarked); 
%ID 1 = trait ID of trait 1; 
Feature 2 = trait lower in hierarchy (less frequent, marked); 
%ID 2 = Trait ID of trait 2; 
Type = type of property distinguishing hierarchical relation between traits.

\input{hierarchy}

\subsection*{S8}

Reconstructed probability distributions of variables in our data set over all nodes of the phylogeny, visualized on a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree of Indo-European.
